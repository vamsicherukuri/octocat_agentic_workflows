# OctoCAT Supply Chain Management - Demo Walkthroughs

Comprehensive demo environment showcasing GitHub's enterprise features using a modern TypeScript web application (React frontend + Express API) with an OctoCat Style!

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**Many demos can be shown without an IDE!** Most GitHub features (Issues, Projects, Actions, GHAS, Pull Requests) are web-based and don't require local development setup.

### For IDE-Based Demos

#### Option 1: Codespaces (Recommended)

- ✅ Zero setup - everything pre-configured
- ✅ Docker and dependencies included
- ✅ Automatic API endpoint detection for browser and local VS Code
- ❌ Some Copilot MCP demos (e.g., Playwright) won't work

#### Option 2: Local Checkout

- ✅ Full functionality including all MCP demos
- ✅ Better performance for intensive tasks
- ❌ Requires local setup (see [main README](../../README.md) for instructions)
- **Requirements**: Docker, GitHub PAT with repo permissions

### (optional) VSCode Insiders

You don't need VS Code Insiders unless demoing preview features. In Codespaces, switch via the gear icon (bottom-left) → `Switch to Insiders Version...`

### 🎯 Hooks + Skills + CLI SDK (Unified Demo)

**File:** [hooks-skills-cli-sdk.md](./copilot/hooks-skills-cli-sdk.md)

A single continuous narrative demonstrating three Copilot platform layers using one realistic feature (DeliveryVehicle):

- **Act 1 - Agent Hooks**: Audit logging and checkpoint commits for governance
- **Act 2 - Agent Skills**: Institutional knowledge applied automatically for consistency
- **Act 3 - CLI SDK Fleet**: Parallel agents for test coverage at scale

Use this walkthrough for customer presentations where you want one coherent story rather than three separate features.

### 🛠️ Agent Skills

**File:** [agent-skills.md](./copilot/agent-skills.md)

Demonstrate how Agent Skills encode specific knowledge/patterns/instructions for consistent code generation:

- **Skills Overview**: What Agent Skills are and how they work - as well as when to use Skills vs Custom Instructions
- **API Endpoint Generation**: Use the `api-endpoint` skill to add a new entity (DeliveryVehicle)
- **Pattern Adherence**: Show how generated code follows the encapsulated skill definition

### 🤖 Agentic Workflows

**File:** [agentic-workflows.md](./copilot/agentic-workflows.md)

Demonstrate AI-powered GitHub Actions workflows that reason, adapt, and act autonomously:

- **Workflow Creation**: Use CCA to "vibe-code" a new agentic workflow from scratch
- **Auto-Analyze Failures**: Automatic build failure triage, issue creation, and Copilot assignment
- **Daily Activity Summary**: Scheduled autonomous repo reporting
- **PR Doc & Test Review**: Agentic PR reviewer that enforces documentation and test coverage standards

### ✨ GitHub Spark

**File:** [spark.md](./copilot/spark.md)

Demonstrate how Product Managers can go from idea to prototype to deployed app:

- **App Creation**: Create a full-stack prototype from a natural language prompt
- **Real-Time Editing**: Point-and-edit experience for refining UI and logic
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Validate ideas early without setup friction

### 🔒 GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)

**File:** [ghas.md](./ghas.md)
